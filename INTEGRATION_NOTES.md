# PolyGun Netcode Integration Notes

## Overview
The project has been updated to use the new authoritative server netcode architecture. The old networking system has been replaced with a modern, competitive-ready system featuring client-side prediction, lag compensation, and rollback netcode.

## Major Changes Made

### 1. Scene Structure Updates (`Scenes/scene.tscn`)
- **Removed**: Old player prefab reference
- **Added**: Direct `ModernPlayerController` as the player
- **Added**: `NetworkSystems` node containing:
  - `NetworkTick` - 64Hz tick system for deterministic simulation
  - `AuthoritativeServer` - Server-side authority with lag compensation
  - `ClientPrediction` - Client-side prediction and reconciliation
- **Kept**: WorldEnvironment and CSGMesh3D level geometry unchanged

### 2. Player Controller Migration
- **Old**: `PlayerController.cs` (legacy system)
- **New**: `ModernPlayerController.cs` (netcode-ready)

#### ModernPlayerController Features:
- Network ID and player name for multiplayer
- Client-side prediction integration
- Network state interpolation for remote players
- Modern weapon system integration
- Health and damage system
- Respawn functionality

### 3. Game Manager Updates (`Scripts/GameManager.cs`)
- Updated to work with `ModernPlayerController`
- Integrated with network systems
- Added network event handlers
- Improved respawn system

### 4. UI Manager Updates (`Scripts/UIManager.cs`)
- Connected to `ModernPlayerController` events
- Integrated with new weapon system for ammo display
- Simplified and improved UI structure

### 5. New Weapon System (`Scripts/Core/ModernWeaponSystem.cs`)
- Replaces old weapon system
- Network-ready architecture
- Multiple weapon support (Pistol, Assault Rifle)
- Proper ammo management
- Reload system with timing
- Weapon switching with mouse wheel and number keys

### 6. Input Map Extensions (`project.godot`)
- **Added**: `alt_fire` (Right mouse button)
- **Added**: `crouch` (C key)
- **Added**: `use` (F key)
- **Added**: `weapon_4` and `weapon_5` (4 and 5 keys)

## Network Architecture

### Core Components

1. **NetworkTick** (`Scripts/Core/NetworkTick.cs`)
   - 64Hz tick rate for competitive gameplay
   - Deterministic simulation timing
   - Command buffering system

2. **AuthoritativeServer** (`Scripts/Core/AuthoritativeServer.cs`)
   - Server-side authority
   - Lag compensation with rollback
   - Anti-cheat validation
   - Hit detection and damage processing

3. **ClientPrediction** (`Scripts/Core/ClientPrediction.cs`)
   - Client-side movement prediction
   - Server reconciliation
   - Input buffering and replay

4. **PlayerCommand** (`Scripts/Core/PlayerCommand.cs`)
   - Input serialization for network transmission
   - Validation and anti-cheat measures

5. **NetworkPlayer** (`Scripts/Core/NetworkPlayer.cs`)
   - Server-side player representation
   - State snapshots for rollback
   - Weapon state management

## How It Works

### Single Player Mode
- All systems work normally without networking
- Local player gets `NetworkId = 1`
- Server systems run locally for consistency

### Multiplayer Mode
1. **Client Input**: Player inputs are captured as `PlayerCommand` objects
2. **Prediction**: Client predicts movement locally for responsiveness
3. **Network Send**: Commands sent to authoritative server
4. **Server Process**: Server validates and processes all commands deterministically
5. **Server Response**: Server sends back authoritative world state
6. **Reconciliation**: Client compares prediction with server state and corrects if needed

## Features

### Lag Compensation
- Server rolls back world state to when client fired
- Hit detection performed in the past where client aimed
- Up to 1 second of compensation (configurable)

### Anti-Cheat
- Command validation on server
- Movement bounds checking
- Sequence number validation to prevent replay attacks
- Delta time validation

### Weapon System
- **Pistol**: 12 rounds, 25 damage, 0.5s fire rate
- **Assault Rifle**: 30 rounds, 20 damage, 0.1s fire rate
- Automatic reload when empty
- Manual reload with R key
- Weapon switching with mouse wheel or number keys

## Controls

### Movement
- **WASD**: Movement
- **Space**: Jump
- **C**: Crouch (ready for implementation)
- **Shift**: Run/Sprint (from old system)

### Combat
- **Left Click**: Shoot
- **Right Click**: Alt Fire (ready for implementation)
- **R**: Reload
- **Mouse Wheel**: Switch weapons
- **1-5**: Select specific weapon
- **Q/E**: Next/Previous weapon

### General
- **ESC**: Pause menu
- **F**: Use/Interact (ready for implementation)

## Level Design

The level is designed in the Godot editor using:
- **WorldEnvironment**: For lighting and atmosphere
- **CSGMesh3D objects**: For walls and level geometry
- **StaticBody3D**: For the floor with physics material

No level generation is done in code - everything is visual and editable in the scene.

## Files to Remove (Old System)
- `Scripts/PlayerController.cs` - Replaced by `ModernPlayerController.cs`
- `Scripts/WeaponSystem.cs` - Replaced by `ModernWeaponSystem.cs`
- `Prefabs/player.tscn` - Player now directly in scene

## Performance Notes
- 64Hz tick rate provides smooth, competitive gameplay
- Client prediction eliminates input lag
- Server authority prevents cheating
- Rollback system keeps memory usage reasonable (64 ticks = 1 second history)

## Testing
1. Run the scene - should work in single player mode immediately
2. For multiplayer testing, you'll need to implement a lobby system
3. All network systems are ready and will activate when multiplayer peer is created

## Next Steps for Multiplayer
1. Add lobby/matchmaking system
2. Implement server hosting
3. Add player spawning/despawning
4. Add team/faction system if needed
5. Expand weapon roster
6. Add more interactive level elements
